azure-storage-mime-updater
==========================

Updates azure blobs with valid content types for their file extensions

Usage
---

For now, there's not a great interface to this package.
Best bet is to clone it, then copy "config.template.js" to "config.js" and enter your blob info (account name, account key, and container name).

Then run `node mime.js`
